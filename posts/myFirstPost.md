## Metadata
The meta data section between the '---' lines above won't be published to the body of your post. In the meta, you can specify the following fields:

1. "title:" This is the title of your post

2. "tags:" You can list the technologies your post covers(e.g. "tags: Javascript, AngularJS")

Any metadata fields other than those listed above will be ignored.

## Markdown
The body of your post can accept any markdown content. If you are unfamiliar with markdown syntax, check out this link: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)

## Code Blocks
You can add formated code blocks into your block post by including your code inside of two sets of triple backticks.  For example:

```
var test = function() {
  console.log("I can't believe how easy it is to write awesome blog posts!");
}
```

## Images
If you would like to include images in your posts, you can reference the image URL in one of two ways:

1. Link to images on the web using the absolute path (e.g. "http://www.example.com/myImg.jpg")
1. Add images to the images folder of your repo and reference them using the relative 'images' path (e.g. 
"images/myImg.jpg")
